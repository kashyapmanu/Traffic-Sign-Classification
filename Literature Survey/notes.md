# Paper-1: Towards Relaible Traffic Sign Recognition

Abstract

    Demand for the reliable traffic sign recognition system increases with the development of safety driven advanced driver assistance systems(ADAS).

    This paper presents a robust system architecture for the reliable recognition of the circular traffic signs.

    This paper introduces the application of local SIFT features for content based traffic sign detection along with widely applied shape based approaches.

        SIFT?
        Scale Invariant Feature Transform.
        The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a feature detection algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images. It was published by David Lowe in 1999.[1] Applications include object recognition, robotic mapping and navigation, image stitching, 3D modeling, gesture recognition, video tracking, individual identification of wildlife and match moving.

    Further adds a technique called contracting curve desnity (CCD) to refine the localization of the detected traffic sign candiadates and thus increasing the performance of the subsequesnt classification module.
